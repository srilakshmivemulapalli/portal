OS X: You need only one tiny command to start a web server from any directory through OS X's terminal. If you've got a web site lying around and need to test it out, this is possibly the fastest way to make that happen.

Just navigate to the directory you want to use and enter the following command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

You may want to change the port if you already have something running on 8000, but other than that the command doesn't require much alteration. It's a great little snippet to keep in mind (or in your TextExpander shortcuts) for the next time you need a quick little web server.
